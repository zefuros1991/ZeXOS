# Video Wallpaper

Animated and video wallpapers for Noctalia, powered by
[mpvpaper](https://github.com/GhostNaN/mpvpaper).

Noctalia does not decode video itself. This plugin runs `mpvpaper`, which draws its own
`wlr-layer-shell` background surface, and asks Noctalia to drop its wallpaper on the
outputs you assign a video to - so the video shows through, with the bar and dock still
drawn above it.

In addition to single-file wallpapers, the plugin can run **directory slideshows**:
when you set a slideshow interval from the picker, mpvpaper loops over all supported
videos in the selected file’s directory, starting at the one you clicked.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `noctalia/mpvpaper` |
| Entries | Service: `service`; Panel: `picker`; bar widget: `mpvpaper`; Shortcut: `shortcut` |

## Requirements

Install `mpvpaper` and `mpv` on `PATH`. `mpvpaper` renders the wallpaper
surface, and `mpv` renders picker thumbnails.

For slideshow state tracking (so the picker highlights the correct tile and static
wallpaper frames follow the current slideshow file), the service talks to mpv over
JSON IPC using the `socat` command; if `socat` is missing, slideshows still play, but
tile highlighting and static-frame extraction may not reflect the current file.

The plugin works on `wlr-layer-shell` compositors (Niri, Hyprland, Sway, Mango).

## Usage

1. Set **Video directory** in the plugin settings (defaults to `~/Videos`).
2. Add the **Video Wallpaper** bar widget, the control center shortcut, or open the picker with

   ```sh
   noctalia msg panel-toggle noctalia/mpvpaper:picker
   ```

3. Choose a target output (or **All outputs**), then click a video to apply it.
   Use **Stop** to restore Noctalia's own wallpaper on that output.

4. To enable a **slideshow**, click the **Slideshow** button in the picker’s
   header to swap the controls for the interval slider. Drag the slider to choose an interval
   (in minutes) and release to commit; the service converts this to seconds and
   passes `--slideshow <seconds>` to mpvpaper, building a playlist from all
   supported videos in that directory, starting at the file you selected. Click the button again to return to the output controls.

Assignments (including the last slideshow interval) persist across restarts. Supported
files: `mp4`, `webm`, `mkv`, `mov`, `gif`.

## IPC Commands

You can control the video wallpaper externally via Noctalia's IPC mechanism. Replace `[connector]` with your display name (e.g. `DP-1`), or omit it to target all monitors:

- `noctalia msg plugin noctalia/mpvpaper:service all pause [connector]` - Pauses playback via cgroups freezer (or SIGSTOP when systemd is disabled).
- `noctalia msg plugin noctalia/mpvpaper:service all resume [connector]` - Resumes playback.
- `noctalia msg plugin noctalia/mpvpaper:service all toggle [connector]` - Toggles playback between paused and resumed state.
- `noctalia msg plugin noctalia/mpvpaper:service all clear <connector>` - Stops the wallpaper on the specified monitor and extracts a frame as a static wallpaper (when enabled).
- `noctalia msg plugin noctalia/mpvpaper:service all clear-all` - Stops all active video wallpapers.
- `noctalia msg plugin noctalia/mpvpaper:service all reapply` - Re-applies the last applied wallpaper, relaunching mpvpaper; also force-restarts a running one or revives a dead one. Made for lock/unlock hooks: clear-all on lock, reapply on unlock.
- `noctalia msg plugin noctalia/mpvpaper:service all slideshow <minutes>` - Changes the slideshow interval to the value in minutes

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `video_directory` | `folder` | *(empty)* | Folder scanned for wallpaper videos; defaults to `~/Videos` when empty. |
| `mute` | `bool` | `true` | Starts video wallpapers muted. |
| `hardware_decode` | `bool` | `true` | Uses `mpv` hardware decoding. |
| `auto_pause` | `select` | `"full"` | Automatically pauses playback while a window covers the wallpaper (`off`, `maximized`, or `fullscreen`). Experimental upstream; behavior varies by compositor — see the [mpvpaper man page](https://github.com/GhostNaN/mpvpaper/blob/master/mpvpaper.man). |
| `mpv_options` | `string` | *(empty)* | Additional space-separated `mpv` options (forwarded via `-o`), e.g. `panscan=1.0 video-zoom=0.1`. |
| `run_as_systemd` | `bool` | `false` | Runs instances inside systemd transient scopes (`systemd-run`) for resource control. |
| `extract_last_frame` | `bool` | `true` | Extracts a static frame to use as a wallpaper when video playback is stopped or paused. |
| `cpu_quota` | `number` | `0` | Systemd `CPUQuota=` limit in percentage. Requires `run_as_systemd`. |
| `allowed_cpus` | `string` | *(empty)* | Systemd `AllowedCPUs=` limits (e.g., `0-3`). Requires `run_as_systemd`. |
| `memory_max` | `string` | *(empty)* | Systemd `MemoryMax=` limits (e.g., `500M`). Requires `run_as_systemd`. |
| `cpu_weight` | `number` | `0` | Systemd `CPUWeight=` priority. Requires `run_as_systemd`. |
| `nice` | `number` | `0` | Process `nice` priority level. Requires `run_as_systemd`. |
| `glyph` | `glyph` | `movie` | Bar widget icon. |

## How it works

A headless service natively supervises `mpvpaper` instances (one per output), either launching them directly or wrapping them in systemd transient scopes (`systemd-run`) for strict CPU and memory resource limits. The picker panel and bar widget are thin clients that drive the service through the plugin's shared state.

On startup, the service queries `mpvpaper --help` to detect whether the binary supports the newer `--auto-mode` flag (mpvpaper 1.9+). When supported, the configured auto-pause mode is passed through as `--auto-pause --auto-mode FULL|MAX`. On older versions, only the plain `--auto-pause` flag exists, so the plugin degrades to fullscreen-only auto-pausing instead of failing to launch.

When you set a slideshow interval, the service builds an `.m3u` playlist from all supported videos in the selected file’s directory and starts `mpvpaper` with that playlist and `--slideshow` enabled. The service then polls `mpv` over JSON IPC (via `socat`) to track which file is currently shown. This syncs the UI assignments and static wallpaper frames, ensuring the picker highlights the right tile and stop operations extract the correct static frame.

When the plugin is disabled or Noctalia exits, the service's `onExit` hook terminates every running `mpvpaper` instance — including frozen or paused ones — so no orphan processes remain.
